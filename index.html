          Hi, I'm a new freelance web developer building my portfolio while
          creating websites for small businesses. I create clean, responsive
          websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — perfect for small
          businesses that want something professional without paying
          agency-level prices. I’ve already built real sites for a small
          construction business and a beginner music producer, and I’m offering
          reduced pricing while I gain more experience.

        <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Here are a couple of small business websites I've recently built from
          scratch. Both are fully responsive, lightweight, and designed to give
          clients a simple, clean online presence — without unnecessary
          complexity.

          <h3>Accurate Construction</h3>
          <p>
            A simple one-page website built from scratch for a small
            construction business. The goal was to create a clean online
            presence with clear sections and easy navigation. Fully responsive,
            so it looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops.
